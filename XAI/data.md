## Practice data
Practice data will be available under 'Files' and consist of a small set of portable chest radiographs and annotations (outlines) of lung opacities by 3 expert radiologists. Note that in the challenge, also normal radiographs without lung opacities will be included.

## Training data
An annotated training set will not be provided for this challenge. Participants are welcome to train using their own data, publicly available data from the MIDRC portal ([data.midrc.org](https://data.midrc.org)), or from other repositories. 

## Validation and test data
Validation and test data are not available for download. You will submit your algorithm in a Docker Image as described in 'How to submit' and inference will be run on the platorm against validation and test sets, respectively, depending on the challenge phase.
