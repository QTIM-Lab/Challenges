## Performance evaluation 
As stated in other sections, the task concerns the classification of frontal view portable chest radiographs (CXRs) for the presence of pneumonia, both on a by-image basis (the overall classification task) and on a by-pixel basis (the explainability maps). 
All CXR images (a single antero-posterior view CXR per patient in DICOM format) have been annotated by 3 expert radiologists (out of a pool of 14 expert annotators). 
The expert manual outlines of lung opacities have been used to generate probability maps for the presence of lung opacities, with regions annotated by 3 experts receiving a probability of 1, by 2 annotators a probability of 1/2, by one annotator a probability of 1/3, and by none of the annotators a probability of 0. Note that also ‘normal’ images without any lung opacities are included in the validation and test sets. 

### Calculation of the primary performance metric
The weighted log-loss is used to assess the participant-generated by-pixel AI explainability maps. In the assessment of these participant-generated explainability maps, to reward accurate localizations and penalize false-positive regions, the expert probability maps are used as reference standard to calculate the weighted log-loss using the following weighting scheme:

### Calculation of the secondary performance metric
The area under the receiver operating curve (AUCROC) is used to assess the image-based performance in the task of classifying CXRs as depicting pneumonia-associated lung opacities or not. The participant-generated by-image AI output is used in this evaluation.
