## Challenge logistics 
The Challenge has 3 phases: (1) a training phase (which includes practice submissions so that you can familiarize yourself with the platform and code containerization), (2) a validation phase, and (3) a test phase. 

### Set org name
Please click your profile at the top right corner where your screen name is to create an "Organization" in your individual profile settings. If someone on your team already already made an org for your teams, they can add users from the already existing organization by:
* Selecting the Org in the Profile dropdown.
* Clicking "Edit Organization" in the top left.
* Under "Organization Edit" towards the bottom right will be a green button for "Invite Users".
* Leaderboard results will now show as organizer.
* NOTE: You do not get more than the limit per person with multiple team members. We will monitor and consider the first submissions by all organization members within both the time limit and submission limit to ensure fair participation by all. If you don't need multiple accounts for your organization, we recommend creating just one to save yourself the hassle. 

### Training phase 
During the Challenge training phase, you should work on model development and training on your local hardware. At this time, you also have the opportunity to perform practice submissions. For this purpose, a small set of ‘practice’ chest radiographs in DICOM format are available for download directly from the Challenge platform. Submissions to the Challenge platform during the training phase will perform inference on this very limited number of ‘practice’ DICOM images. This is intended to allow you to troubleshoot general issues with Docker submissions, reading DICOM images, and to verify that your algorithm's output is the same locally as on the Challenge platform. This small dataset is not intended for training. Please use this opportunity to "test drive" the submission process and resolve any issues you encounter to minimize potential problems during later phases. Only limited technical assistance will be available after the training phase.
Note that an annotated training dataset is not provided by Challenge organizers and you are free to train your model using publicly available MIDRC data (no manual outlines of lung opacities), other publicly available data, as well as your own data. Datasets used need to be disclosed when submitting in the test phase. 
### Validation phase 
During the Challenge validation phase, you will submit your trained model(s) to the Challenge platform to perform inference and evaluation on the unpublished validation set (which will not be available for download). The validation phase allows you to (1) further familiarize yourself with the containerization and submission process of your code and trained model(s) and (2) to fine-tune your model(s). A Leaderboard will be available during the validation phase to promote friendly competition. There is a maximum of 10 submissions per team in this phase. 
### Test phase 
During the Challenge test phase, you will submit your most promising model(s) to the Challenge platform for inference and evaluation on the unpublished test set (which will not be available for download). There is a maximum of 3 submissions per team in this phase. Please review the "Terms and Conditions" for additional important information.  
### Questions and help 
Discussion of the Challenge on the Forum ("Forum" tab) is encouraged. The Forum should be used for any questions you may have about this Challenge so that Challenge organizers can help if needed, and other participants can benefit from questions and answers. 
### Ready to participate? 
Once you are ready to participate, log in or register for an account when prompted. You are required to agree to the Challenge "Terms and Conditions" to access the Challenge platform so please read them beforehand.
