# MIDRC mRALE Mastermind Challenge:

## Developing AI to predict COVID Severity on Chest Radiographs

### Brought to you by the MIDRC Grand Challenges Working Group and MedICI 

#### Registration is now open. Please note, however, that the Challenge platform capabilities and materials won't be fully available until the competition starts May 15. See you then at the starting line!

The MIDRC mRALE Mastermind Challenge is organized in the spirit of cooperative scientific progress that benefits the common good and health outcomes for all. Your contributions could help advance the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19.

The goal of this Challenge is to train an artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) model in the task of predicting COVID severity in terms of mRALE score [[Li et al]](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/ryai.2020200079) from frontal-view portable chest X-ray radiographs (CXRs) obtained within 2 days of a positive COVID-19 test. This Challenge provides annotated training data, i.e., chest radiographs and their mRALE scores as assigned by a team of experts. The data for model validation and testing will not be made available for download, however. Instead, you will submit containerized code of your trained model for inference on this Challenge platform against the validation and test datasets. This Challenge uses Docker as a containerization solution.

## Prize
### Winner: MIDRC support to take your method/model through the FDA regulatory process (if warranted by its performance).

All participants with valid submissions in the Challenge test phase will receive contributor credit on Challenge manuscripts and acknowledgement at AAPM and RSNA 2023 annual meetings as well as on [midrc.org](http://midrc.org/).

We are excited to be conducting this Challenge and hope you will participate! We encourage you to invite your colleagues and friends to create a team.
