queue: null
description: The American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) is sponsoring
  the CT Metal Artifact Reduction (CT-MAR) Challenge leading up to the 2024 AAPM Annual
  Meeting & Exhibition. We will invite participants to develop a 2D metal artifact
  reduction (MAR) algorithm. Both deep learning (DL) and non-DL approaches are welcome.
  Solutions can operate in the image-domain, in the sinogram-domain, or in a combination
  of both. A large set of image pairs and sinogram pairs will be provided for training
  and testing as well as a smaller dataset for scoring. The final score will be computed
  as a weighted average of dozens of clinically focused image quality metrics. The
  challenge organizers will summarize the challenge results in a journal publication.
  Please note, the two top-performing teams will be awarded complimentary meeting
  registration to present on their methodologies during the 2024 AAPM Annual Meeting
  & Exhibition in Los Angeles, CA from July 21-25, 2024 (in-person attendance is required).
